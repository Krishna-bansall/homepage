# ===========================================
# TYPOGRAPHY CONFIGURATION
# ===========================================
# A clean, readable typographic system based on:
# - 16px base for comfortable reading
# - 1.5 line height for body text (optimal for readability)
# - Minor Third scale (1.2) for harmonious sizing
# - 4px baseline grid for vertical rhythm
# - 65 character measure for ideal line length
# ===========================================

# --- BASE SETTINGS ---
base_font_size: "16px"           # Standard readable base
base_line_height: 1.6            # Comfortable reading height
base_unit: "1.5rem"              # 24px vertical rhythm unit

# --- MODULAR SCALE ---
# Using Minor Third (1.2) - gentle, readable progression
# More subtle than Major Third, better for long-form reading
scale:
  ratio: 1.2
  xs: "0.694rem"   # 11px - captions, fine print
  sm: "0.833rem"   # 13px - small text, metadata
  base: "1rem"     # 16px - body text
  md: "1.2rem"     # 19px - h4, lead text
  lg: "1.44rem"    # 23px - h3
  xl: "1.728rem"   # 28px - h2
  xxl: "2.074rem"  # 33px - h1
  hero: "2.488rem" # 40px - hero titles

# --- MEASURE (Line Length) ---
# 45-75 characters per line is optimal
# 65 characters is the sweet spot for readability
measure:
  narrow: "30rem"   # ~45 characters - sidebars, cards
  optimal: "38rem"  # ~65 characters - ideal reading width
  wide: "48rem"     # ~75 characters - code blocks, tables

# --- SPACING ---
# Based on 4px baseline grid (0.25rem)
# Simple doubling progression for predictability
spacing:
  xs: "0.25rem"     # 4px  - tight gaps
  sm: "0.5rem"      # 8px  - inline spacing
  base: "1rem"      # 16px - standard gap
  md: "1.5rem"      # 24px - between elements
  lg: "2rem"        # 32px - section spacing
  xl: "3rem"        # 48px - major sections
  xxl: "4rem"       # 64px - page sections
