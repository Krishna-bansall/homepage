circuits could be considered black-boxes, that take discrete valued signals / variables, so i think the idea is to view circuit as functions basically, they take input variables and have output variables
- now they have a *functional* and a *timing* specification made entirely to describe
	- relations between input & output
	- describing the delays between the incoming input & the outgoing output

(this idea generally seems sound because we are considering the circuit to be a black-box again)

- see or gate just lets you do anything, in a mux, the intuition is sort of clear

Now withing the circuit there are several *nodes* and *elements* that are black boxes of their own
- *node* is a wire with a voltage conveying a strict 0 or 1 voltage
	- there can be different nodes -> input, output or internal nodes
		- input nodes are bringing data into the system
		- output nodes are providing data outside the system of the element / circuit
		- now this black-box being created makes perfect sense as this is a black box that scales where you can peak whenever you are required.
	- remember nodes are wires carrying discrete variables

- note: timing specification have a (upper) & (lower) bound
- the rules of combinational composition, allows us to build larger combinational circuits using abstraction from smaller circuits 

**Black box vs peeked-in unabstracted**

### Types of circuits in digital logic
- [[Combinational logic]]
	- the current input values provided only determined the output
	- for eg logic gates, give them some input nodes it computes your result you are happy, you dont care about the previous values
	- mathematical functions like
	- for a circuit to be combinational
		- every internal element is to be combinational
		- nodes have to be connected to be one single output only, a node cant be connected to multiple outputs at once 
		- no circularity, i.e each node visit each element at max once, they cant touch an element again
- [[Sequential logic]]
	- they care about current input values as well as, the previous set of instructions
	- they require memory, i would guess, they would requier an array or register or whatever that keeps a track of all the input variables, for some reason
	- *why would that sort of circuit be useful?*
