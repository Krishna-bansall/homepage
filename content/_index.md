Welcome, internet stranger! You've landed on my little corner on the web. This site is an *experiment* in sharing ideas, projects, and things that capture my imagination.

A few big ideas I keep coming back to:

- *Computing* - the nature of computers: how they're built, the limits of computation, and how we can build better, much more useful machines
- *Modelling* - the world is so complex, we understand so little of it, science and mathematics are our way to make feeble attempts to understand this world, which is endlessly fascinating!
- *Emergence* - how simple rules and interactions give rise to complexity and surprising behaviour

These days I spend my time mostly tinkering with *low-level* software and hardware, and exploring [new types of computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_computing)
